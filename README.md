Stock Memer is a app that allows users to get up to date information on stocks, along with the last 30 days of stock information.

The user selects a company from the dropdown list and the company information is displayed. The 30 day info is seen on the graph, and the 
current moment stock info is located directly below the company selector dropdown.

The user can also comment of the general stat of the stock market by way of making thier own memes. This also works by way of dropdownbox but this one has inputs for the user to fill out. The top input is for the posters name. The second is for the top text of the meme and the third is for the bottom text of the meme.
